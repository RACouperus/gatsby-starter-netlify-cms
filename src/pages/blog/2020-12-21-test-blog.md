Like all lawyers they Ale thinks he is great. That is right, this is the odd case that he is completely right about his unlimited abilities. This guy can do practically anything he sets his mind to. Great guy and quite prette. By the way, he is the greatest kitesurfer (not including pro's) --> he could be a pro offcourse and than he would be the best, by a landslide!
